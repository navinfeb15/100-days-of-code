#  Analyzing Salary Data

This README provides an overview of the code for analyzing salary data by college major using a CSV file. The code is written in Python and utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

## Uploading and Reading the Data

To use the code, you need to upload the salary data file in CSV format. Make sure the file is named 'salaries_by_college_major.csv'. The code reads the file into a Pandas dataframe and allows you to explore the data.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

After reading the data, you can perform data exploration and cleaning tasks. The code allows you to check the dimensions of the dataframe, list the column names, check for missing values, and preview the data. Additionally, you can create a cleaned dataframe by dropping rows with missing values.

## Accessing Columns and Individual Cells

The code demonstrates how to access specific columns or individual cells within the dataframe. You can find the maximum value in a column, find the index of a specific value, and access values in specific columns or rows.

## Highest and Lowest Earning Degrees

The code provides solutions to find the highest and lowest earning degrees based on the salary data. You can find the maximum value in a specific column, find the index of the row with the maximum value, and access the corresponding data.

## Sorting Values and Adding Columns

The code includes examples of sorting values and adding columns to the dataframe. You can calculate the spread between two columns and sort the dataframe based on specific columns to analyze majors with the most potential and lowest risk.

## Grouping and Pivoting Data with Pandas

The code demonstrates how to group and pivot data using Pandas. You can group the dataframe by a specific column and calculate summary statistics for each group.

Please note that the code provided is not executable on its own and should be used as a reference for understanding the analysis process. You can modify and extend the code based on your specific requirements and explore further analysis options using the provided dataset.
