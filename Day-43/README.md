This is a simple  HTML file  that displays the names of colors in Spanish along with corresponding images. Your task is to style the HTML file using CSS.

## Instructions

1.  Create a new  CSS file  and link it to the HTML file using the  `link`  tag in the  `head`  section of the file.
    
2.  Use CSS to style each of the  color titles  to match their meaning in Spanish. You can use the  `id`  attribute of each  `h2`  tag to help you if you don't know the words in Spanish.
    
3.  Change all the color titles to have a  `font-weight`  of  `normal`.
    
4.  Use CSS (not HTML) to make all the images 200px in height and 200px in width. You can use the  `height`  and  `width`  properties to achieve this.
