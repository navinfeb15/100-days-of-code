# Typing Speed Checker

This is a Python application that allows you to test and measure your typing speed. It presents you with a series of random words to type, and calculates your Corrected Characters Per Minute (CPM) and Words Per Minute (WPM) based on your input.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ````
   pip install tkinter
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

1. Run the `typing_speed_checker.py` file:
   ````
   python typing_speed_checker.py
2. The application window will appear.
3. Click on the "Start" button to begin the typing test.
4. Type the displayed words in the input field.
5. Press the Space key to move on to the next set of words.
6. After 60 seconds, the test will end automatically and a message box will display your score.
7. To end the test before the time limit, click the "End test" button.
8. You can start a new test by clicking the "Start" button again.

## Customization

- You can modify the text used for the typing test by editing the `paragraphs.txt` file. Each line represents a paragraph, and words should be separated by spaces.
- You can customize the appearance of the application by modifying the relevant Tkinter code in the `TypingSpeedApp` class.
