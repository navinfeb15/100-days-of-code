# Pong Game

The Pong Game is a classic two-player arcade game implemented using Python's turtle module. The game simulates a table tennis match, where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, trying to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

## Features

- Player controls:
  - Player 1: Up arrow key (move paddle up) and Down arrow key (move paddle down)
  - Player 2: 'W' key (move paddle up) and 'S' key (move paddle down)

- Ball movement:
  - The ball moves diagonally across the screen at a constant speed
  - The ball bounces off the walls and paddles, changing direction accordingly
  - As the game progresses, the ball's speed increases

- Scoreboard:
  - The game keeps track of each player's score and displays it on the screen
  - Player 1's score is displayed on the left side, and Player 2's score is displayed on the right side
