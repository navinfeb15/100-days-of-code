# LEGO Dataset Analysis

This repository contains code and instructions for analyzing the LEGO dataset. The dataset provides information about LEGO sets, themes, parts, and colors. It allows us to explore various aspects of LEGO's history and product offerings.

## Data Source

The LEGO dataset is available for download from [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/). You can find the necessary CSV files in the data folder of this repository.

## Instructions

To explore the LEGO dataset, follow the instructions provided below:

1. **Data Exploration**: Start by loading the dataset and performing initial data exploration tasks.

2. **Understanding LEGO Colors**: Use the colors.csv file to find the total number of unique colors produced by the LEGO company. You can use the `.nunique()` method from the pandas library to accomplish this.

3. **LEGO Themes vs. LEGO Sets**: Understand the relationship between LEGO themes and sets. Display the provided image (https://i.imgur.com/aKcwkSx.png) to visualize the concept of LEGO sets within a theme.

5. **First LEGO Sets**: Find out in which year the first LEGO sets were released and what they were called.

6. **LEGO Set Statistics**: Explore the dataset to answer questions about the number of sets released in different years, the top sets with the most number of parts, and the average number of parts per set over time.

7. **LEGO Themes**: Determine which LEGO theme has the largest number of individual sets.

8. **Database Schema**: Display the database schema image (https://i.imgur.com/Sg4lcjx.png) to understand the structure and relationships between the different tables in the LEGO dataset.

9. **Merging DataFrames**: Explore the themes.csv and sets.csv files to understand how they are structured and how they can be merged based on the theme_id column.

Please refer to the code and instructions provided in the repository for detailed explanations and solutions to each challenge.

Feel free to modify and extend the code to perform additional analyses or answer your own questions about the LEGO dataset.

Enjoy exploring the world of LEGO!
