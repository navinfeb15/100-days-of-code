# Pixela API Demo

This is a  Python script  that demonstrates the use of the  Pixela API  to create a new  user account, create a new graph, add a new pixel to the graph, update an existing pixel, and delete an existing pixel.

## Getting started

### Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Requests library

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2.  Install the  `requests`  library by running  `pip install requests`  in your terminal.

### Configuration

Before running the script, you need to configure the following variables in the code:

-   `url_endpoint`: The  base URL  for the  Pixela  API.
-   `TOKEN`: Your Pixela API token.
-   `USERNAME`: Your Pixela username.
-   `GRAPH_ID`: The ID of the graph you want to create.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute the  `pixela_demo.py`  file in your terminal:

```
python main.py
```

The script will create a new user account, create a new graph, add a new pixel, update an existing pixel, and delete an existing pixel, each with its own  API request.
