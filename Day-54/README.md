# Flask Web Development Tutorial

This repository contains a tutorial on developing websites using Flask, one of the most popular web development frameworks in Python.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following:

- Python installed on your system
- Flask package installed

## Steps

1. Read the Flask documentation to understand the basics of Flask and how to get started quickly.

2. Create a new project folder for your Flask application.

3. Inside the project folder, create a new Python file. Make sure the file name does not conflict with any existing module or package names.

4. Install Flask using one of the following methods:
   - Click on the red light bulb in the code editor to install Flask.
   - Go to PyCharm preferences and add the Flask package in the project interpreter settings.
   - Use the terminal and run the command `pip install Flask`.

5. Copy the minimal Flask application code from the Flask documentation and paste it into your Python file.

6. Set the FLASK_APP environment variable to point to your Flask application file. Use the following command in the terminal:
   - For Mac: `export FLASK_APP=hello.py`
   - For Windows: `set FLASK_APP=hello.py`

7. Run the Flask application using the `flask run` command in the terminal.

8. Access your Flask website by opening the provided local address in your browser.

9. Verify that your Flask application is working correctly by checking if the desired content is displayed.

10. Stop the Flask server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Additional Information

- The tutorial assumes you are using PyCharm as the code editor, but the steps can be adapted to other editors or IDEs.
- The tutorial covers the basic setup and running of a Flask application. For production-ready deployment, further steps are required.

Feel free to modify and enhance this README file as needed to suit your project requirements.

Happy Flask web development!
