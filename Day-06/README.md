# Reeborg's Maze

This is a Python script for solving a maze using the Reeborg's World environment. The script uses the Reeborg's World library to control a virtual robot and guide it through the maze.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `reeborg's_maze.py` file.
2. Navigate to the `Day-06` folder.
3. Open the Reeborg's World environment in your web browser by going to https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html.
4. Click on the "Load World" button on the left-hand side of the screen and select the "Maze" world.
5. Open the editor in Reeborg's World by clicking on the "Editor" button on the left-hand side of the screen.
6. Copy and paste the contents of the `reeborg's_maze.py` file into the editor.
7. Click on the "Run" button to execute the script.
8. Watch as the virtual robot navigates through the maze and reaches the end.

## Script Description

The `reeborg's_maze.py` script uses a combination of if-else statements and Reeborg's World commands to control the virtual robot and guide it through the maze. The robot follows a set of rules to determine which direction to move in next, based on its current position and the surrounding walls.

The script is designed to solve the "Maze" world in Reeborg's World, but can be modified to solve other maze-like puzzles as well.

## Controls

The script is executed entirely within the Reeborg's World environment, and is controlled using the buttons and commands available within the environment.
