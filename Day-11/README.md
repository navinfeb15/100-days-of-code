## Game Description

The game of Blackjack is a popular card game in which the player tries to get a higher total value of cards than the dealer without going over 21. In this implementation of the game, the player is dealt two cards to start, and can choose to hit (draw another card) or stand (keep their current hand).

The dealer also draws cards, but must follow a set of rules that dictate when they must hit or stand. The game continues until either the player or the dealer busts (goes over 21), or one of the players reaches a higher total value of cards than the other.

## Controls

The game is played entirely through the keyboard. The player must type 'h' to hit or 's' to stand.
