# This script plays a game of Blackjack
# The game is played between the user and the computer
# The user and the computer are each dealt two cards
# The user can choose to hit (get another card) or pass (not get another card)
# The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over
# If either the user or the computer goes over 21, the other wins
# If both the user and the computer get 21, the user wins
