# Mail Merge Program

The Mail Merge program is a  Python script  that generates  personalized letters  for a list of recipients. The program reads the contents of a template letter file, replaces placeholders in the letter with  recipient names  from a list, and saves a new letter for each recipient.

## Getting Started

To use the  Mail  Merge program, you will need to have  Python 3  installed on your computer. You can download and install Python 3 from the official Python website:  [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

You will also need to have a list of recipient names and a template letter file. The recipient names should be in a text file with one name per line, and the template letter file should be a plain text file with placeholders for the recipient names.

## Usage

To use the Mail Merge program, follow these steps:

1.  Open a terminal or  command prompt window.
    
2.  Change to the directory where the Mail Merge program files are located.
    
3.  Run the following command to start the program:
    

Copy

```
python mail_merge.py

```

4.  The program will prompt you to enter the  file paths  for the  recipient names file  and the template letter file.
    
5.  After you enter the file paths, the program will generate a new letter for each recipient and save it in the  `ReadyToSend`  folder.
