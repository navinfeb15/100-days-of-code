# Day-21
# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game consists of a snake that moves around the screen and eats food, which causes it to grow. The player must avoid running into the walls or the snake's own tail while trying to collect as much food as possible.

## How to Play

To play the game, run the  Python script  `snake_game.py`. The game will start automatically, and you can use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement. The objective of the game is to collect as much food as possible without running into the walls or the snake's own tail.

## Requirements

To run this game, you will need:

-   Python 3.x
-   The  `turtle`  module (included in Python's standard library)

## How to Play

1.  Run the  `snake_game.py`  file using Python.
2.  Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen.
3.  Try to eat as many food items as possible without running into the walls or the snake's own tail.
4.  The game ends when the snake crashes into a wall or its own tail.

## Customization

You can customize this game by modifying the code in the  `snake.py`  file. For example, you can change the size of the  game board, the speed of the snake, or the appearance of the snake and food items.

## Credits

This game was inspired by the classic Snake game, which was first introduced in the late 1970s.
