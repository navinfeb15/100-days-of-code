# 100 Days of Code - Python

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge for Python! Here, I'll be practicing Python programming for 100 days straight, with the aim of improving my skills and knowledge.

## What is the 100 Days of Code challenge?

The 100 Days of Code challenge is a commitment to code for at least one hour every day, for 100 consecutive days. It's a great way to build consistency and develop good coding habits, while also improving your skills and knowledge.

## Why Python?

I've chosen Python for this challenge because it's a versatile and powerful language, used widely in a variety of fields including data science, web development, machine learning, and more. Python is also beginner-friendly, with a clear and easy-to-read syntax.

## What will I be working on?

During this challenge, I'll be working on a variety of Python projects and exercises, including:

-   Building simple games with Pygame
-   Creating data visualizations with Matplotlib
-   Building web applications with Flask
-   Writing scripts to automate tasks
-   Working on coding exercises from online platforms like HackerRank and Codewars

## Follow my progress

To keep track of my progress, I'll be updating my GitHub repository every day with the code I write and the projects I work on. You can follow along by checking out my [100 Days of Code - Python](https://github.com/navinfeb15/100-days-of-code) repository.

Thanks for stopping by! Let's get coding!
