# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. It allows two players to take turns placing their markers on a 3x3 game board until there is a winner or the game ends in a draw.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the files are located.
4. Run the following command to start the game:

   ````
   python tic_tac_toe.py
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 game board.
2. Player 1 chooses their marker (e.g., X) and Player 2 chooses their marker (e.g., O).
3. Players take turns entering the position where they want to place their marker.
4. The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all positions on the game board are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
