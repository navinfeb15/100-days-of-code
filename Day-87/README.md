# Breakout Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Breakout game using the Turtle module in Python. The game involves breaking blocks with a ball by bouncing it off a paddle. The objective is to clear all the blocks while keeping the ball from falling off the bottom of the screen.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

### Usage

To run the game, execute the following command:

```
python breakout.py
```

### Gameplay

-   Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
-   The ball will bounce off the walls, blocks, and the paddle.
-   Break all the blocks to win the game.
-   Each time the ball falls off the bottom, you lose a life.
-   You start with three lives. The game is over when you lose all lives.
