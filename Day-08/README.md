# Day-08
# Caesar's Cipher

This is a Python script for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique in which each letter in the message is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `ceasar's cipher.py` file.
2. Navigate to the `Day-08` folder.
3. Run the script using the `python ceasar's cipher.py` command.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to encrypt or decrypt a message.

## Script Description

The `ceasar's cipher.py` script takes a message and a key as input, and outputs the encrypted or decrypted message based on the Caesar cipher technique. The key is a number that represents the number of positions each letter in the message is shifted down the alphabet.

The script uses a combination of if-else statements and string manipulation to perform the encryption or decryption. The script is designed to work with both uppercase and lowercase letters, and can handle non-alphabetic characters as well.

## Controls

The script is executed through the terminal, and is controlled using the keyboard. The user must input the message, key, and whether they want to encrypt or decrypt the message.
