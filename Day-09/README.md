# Day-09
# Blind Auction

This is a Python script for conducting a blind auction. The auction allows multiple bidders to submit their bids for an item without knowing the bids of the other bidders.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `blind auction.py` file.
2. Navigate to the `Day-09` folder.
3. Run the script using the `python blind auction.py` command.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to conduct the auction.

## Script Description

The `blind auction.py` script takes input from multiple bidders and determines the highest bidder for an item. The bidders submit their bids without knowing the bids of the other bidders, and the script outputs the highest bid and the corresponding bidder.

The script uses a combination of loops, if-else statements, and user input to conduct the auction. The script is designed to handle multiple bidders and bids of different values.

## Controls

The script is executed through the terminal, and is controlled using the keyboard. The user must input the name and bid of each bidder, and must confirm if there are any more bidders.
